# Present! 🙋🏻‍♀️ 🙋🏼

<h2>Inspiration</h2>
<p>Every day in a 40-minute class, 10 minutes are spent just taking attendance. Attendance is inaccurate, and maintaining bulky registers is a pain.</p>
<p>We’ll not anymore; presenting to you Present! one-stop website to Maintain and Record your attendance accurately.</p>

<p>In my College, our professors spent almost 10 minutes calling out each student's name to take attendance.</p>
<p>It’s very tiring and time-consuming, especially in a class of 80 students. Through Present!, not only does it take them less time it also ensures accuracy.</p>

<h2>What it does</h2>

<li>Students and Teachers will register on the portal using their names, phone, and email.</li>
<li>The phone number will be verified using the Twilio service for SMS verification using OTP.</li>
<li>Once registered, the students will be directed to their profile page where a unique QR code is displayed and other details. Whereas in the case of the teachers they will be directed to a page with just their details.</li>
<li>This way the teacher can scan the QR code of the students and mark their attendance</li>
