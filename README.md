<h2>Inspiration</h2>
<p>Every day in a 40-minute class, 10 minutes are spent just taking attendance. Attendance is inaccurate, and maintaining bulky registers is a pain.</p>
<p>We’ll not anymore; presenting to you Present! one-stop website to Maintain and Record your attendance accurately.</p>

<p>In my College, our professors spent almost 10 minutes calling out each student's name to take attendance.</p>
<p>It’s very tiring and time-consuming, especially in a class of 80 students. Through Present!, not only does it take them less time it also ensures accuracy.</p>

<h2>What it does</h2>
<p>This app helps teachers take attendance easily using a QR code</p>

<h2>How we built it</h2>
<p>we build it using next JS, tailwind CSS, and Twilio for handling the SMS verification using generated OTP.</p>
